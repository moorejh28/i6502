# i6502
The Interactive 6502 for Atari 8-bit computers

An Atari BASIC XL program for interacting directly with the 6502 processor registers through a simple point-and-click interface controlled by the joystick. This is not a simulation. Users click on and execute assembly language code that directly manipulates the 6502 X, Y, and A registers. This is designed for use on the Atari 8-bit computers including the 400, 800, and 800XL. The BASIC XL programming language is required. Files include a text file with the source code and an Atari disk image (ATR) that contains the BASIC XL code (i6502.BAS). This is provided as is and may be used for any purpose.
